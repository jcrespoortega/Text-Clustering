In this script we use the strategy of Steamming in order to reduce the amount of vocabulary in texts and achive a less sparse TF-IDF matrix. NLTK is the python library which make english lemmatization in the texts, one example of how steamming works:

Spanish:

Bibliotecas - Bibliotec 
Bibliotecario - Bibliotec


English:

Fishing - Fish
Fished - Fish
