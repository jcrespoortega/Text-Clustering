Text mining and in particular text clasification is a mandatory skill for a Data Scientist. In this proyect I develop a algorithm in order to classify news of digital newspapers in different languages, English and Spanish, in order to clasify its in the correct label based on their topics.

The pipeline for the current proyect is: Scraping the articles, clean and extract the important features for the task and preform and aglomerative clustering. The main tool is Python with the packages of NLTK, News Article3k, Beautiful Soup and scikit-learn.
