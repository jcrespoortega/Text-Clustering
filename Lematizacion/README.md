In this script we use the strategy of lemmatization in order to reduce the amount of vocabulary in texts and achive a less sparse TF-IDF matrix. NLTK is the python library which make english lemmatization in the texts, one example of how lemmatization works:

Spanish:

dije - decir 
dire - decir 

English:

Walked - Walk 
Walks - Walk
